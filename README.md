# My Movie Quotes

- Made using `create-react-native-app` <a href="https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app">Create React Native App</a>
- Uses Expo so you will not have to install Pods every 10 minutes
- Hardly any UI
- I tried to make it with the idea of "dumb" components that didn't do any logic

## ðŸš€ How to use

- node version must be 18.17.0 or greater
- `yarn`
- `yarn ios`
- `yarn android`

## What I would change/fix/improve

- Was going to add downvotes but time ran out
- Upvotes, adding quotes and retrieving data should all obviously be done through an API
- Too many useStates much of it could be moved to a BE
- Tests, ran out of time
